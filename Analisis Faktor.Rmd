First we need to install the needed packages.

```{r}
install.packages("psych")
install.packages("GPArotation")
```
Import packages
```{r}
library(psych)
library(GPArotation)
```

Import data
```{r}
data <- read.csv("EFA.csv")
head(data)
```

Finding the number of factor that will be selected for factor analysis. This is done via methods such as 'Parallel Analysis' and 'eigenvalue', etc.

Here we specify the data frame and factor method (`minres` in our case). Run the following to find an acceptable number of factors and generate the scree plot:

```{r}
fa.parallel(data, fm = 'minres', fa = 'fa')
```
